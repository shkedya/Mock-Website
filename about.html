	<p>Alon's School is an international public research university that brings in people from all 50 states and over 100 countries. We are able to conduct school in a formal or informal setting, this is usually done via ecampus schooling or oncampus schooling. We are a diverse and welcoming school that hope people that come to our campus build a future that's "smarter, healthier, more prosperous and more just." We are a new school so hopefully we get to see a large and diverse populous that comes!
<ul>
	<li>2 campuses - ecampus and otherwise</li>
	<li>1 college - ecampus and regular go to the same college</li>
	<li>5 experiment stations - we will hopefully build more!</li>
	<li>Extension programs in most countries</li> 
	<li>200+ academic programs that bring countless impacts</li>
	</ul>
